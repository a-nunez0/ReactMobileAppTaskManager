Overview
For this mobile app I decided to use react native and expo to put together a task manager app.
The purpose of this app was for me to learn how to do react native and create an app.
React native is there to help create mobile apps and I didn't know anything about it until now.

I need to learn how to use expo.
I need to learn the commands to properly start the app.
For some reason one of my biggest problems was that I couldn't connect my iphone with my microsoft laptop and react was not responding to my expo app in my phone I guesss iyt had somehting
to do with the platforms not being the same.
